## Sample output
<pre class="console">&gt; gradle flywayMigrate -i

Database: jdbc:h2:file:C:\Programs\flyway-0-SNAPSHOT\flyway.db (H2 1.3)

## Important Note

When using Spring JDBC migrations, you must declare a dependency on `org.springframework:spring-jdbc:${springVersion}`
in Gradle's `buildScript` block to avoid being hit with a `java.lang.LinkageError`.
